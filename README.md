# hundred_prisoners_simulation_in_python3
Simulation of the riddle of 100 prisoners and 100 boxes game....
<br/>inspired from a youtube video from Veritasium. video link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA
<br/>"pip install tqdm" to install tqdm module
<br/>tqdm module not really needed normal ranges are enough.. its just to monitor in cases with longer number of games and large nuber of prisoners....

## One sample output:
Playing Random Pick Games: 100%|████████████████████████████████████| 10000/10000 [00:01<00:00, 6666.58it/s]
<br/>Playing Strategic Pick Games: 100%|█████████████████████████████████| 10000/10000 [00:01<00:00, 7195.74it/s]
<br/>Number of prisoners = 100
<br/>Number of random pick games= 10000
<br/>Number of strategic pick games= 10000
<br/>Number of random pick wins = 0  ( 0.0 % )
<br/>Number of strategic pick wins = 3137  ( 31.369999999999997 % )
